Task 2) 
given a string for example
str1 = "Welcome to python"

check if "to" is present in "welcome to python"

Task-3.1
go through other inbuilt methods like remove(),count(),clear(),sort(),reverse()

Task 3.2
Create a list of lenght = 10 and access 5th to 8th data.


Task-4: 2 problems!
1)
#Add item 70 after 60 in the following Python List
#input
l1 = [10, 20, [30, 40, [50, 60], 80], 90, 100]
#output
[10, 20, [30, 40, [50, 60, 70], 80], 90, 100]

2)
#add sublist [7,8] after 6
#input
l2 = [1,2,[3,4,5,6],9]
#output
[1,2,[3,4,5,6,[7,8]],9]

Task-5

code:
dict1 = { 
   "april_batch":{ 
      "student":{ 
         "name":"Mike",
         "marks":{ 
            "python":80,
            "maths":70
         }
      }
   }
}

Questions:
From the above dictionary, do the following tasks

access "Mike"
access 80
change "Mike" to "Your name"
add ML = 80 and DL = 80 inside marks

Task 6 
Add and remove the elements from a tuple. (Refer workaroud to modify the tuples)

Task7 - go through other inbuilt methods like
difference()
symmetric_difference()

Task8 - Make a table of all the In-built data structures and Point out the differences one by one

Task9
Ask 2 numbers from users and store it in num1 and num2
Ask user to press 1 for addition,2 for subtraction,3 for multiplication and 4 for division
based on number given by user do the math operation

Task 10.2 What is pass keyword, with example.

Task 10.3
using while loop print numbers from 10 to 1
try using for loop to loop over tuples,sets and dictionaries

Task10.4 : Go through
reduce()
zip()
enumerate()
